Developing a Web-Based VR Game
--we will build the VR game using React 360 by covering the following
topics:
--Introducing the MERN VR Game
--Getting started with React 360
--Key concepts for developing 3D VR applications
--Defining game details
--Building the game view in React 360
--Bundling the React 360 code to integrate with the MERN skeleton

--After going over these topics, you will be able to apply 3D VR concepts and use React
360 to start building your own VR-based applications.

Lecture 1:
Introducing the MERN VR Game::
--The MERN VR Game web application will be developed by extending the MERN
skeleton and integrating VR capabilities using React 360. It will be a dynamic, webbased
VR game application, in which registered users can make their own games, and
any visitor to the application can play these games.

--The features of the game will be simple enough to reveal the capabilities of
introducing VR into a MERN-based application, without delving too deeply into the
advanced concepts of React 360 that may be used to implement more complex VR
features.

Game features::
--Each game in the MERN VR Game application will essentially be a different VR
world, where users can interact with 3D objects placed at different locations in a 360-
degree panoramic world.

--The gameplay will be similar to that of a scavenger hunt, and to complete each game, users will have to find and collect the 3D objects that are relevant to the clue or
description for each game. This means the game world will contain some VR objects that can be collected by the player and some VR objects that cannot be collected, but
that may be placed by makers of the game as props or hints. Finally, the game will be won when all of the relevant 3D objects have been collected by the user.
