Lecture 1:
VrHeadModel::
--VrHeadModel is a utility module in React 360 that simplifies the process of obtaining
the current orientation of the headset.

--Since the user is moving around in a VR space,
when the desired feature requires that an object or piece of text should be placed in
front of or with respect to the user's current orientation, it becomes necessary to know
exactly where the user is currently gazing.

--we will use this to show the game completed message to the
user in front of their view, no matter where they end up turning to from their initial
position.
--For example, the user may be looking up or down when collecting the final
object, and the completed message should pop up wherever the user is gazing.

--To implement this, we will retrieve the current head matrix as an array of numbers
using getHeadMatrix() from VrHeadModel, and set it as a value for the transform
property in the style attribute of the View component containing the game completed
message.

Loading assets::
--In order to load any static asset files such as image or audio files in the code, we can
utilize the asset method in React 360.

--This asset() functionality in React 360 allows
us to retrieve external resource files, including audio and image files.

--we will place the sound audio files for the game in the static_assets
folder, to be retrieved using asset() for each audio added to the game

--we will integrate
different features for the VR game such as setting the background scene, playing
audio, adding styles, loading static files, and retrieving the user orientation.
