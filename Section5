Lecture 1:
Interacting with VR objects::
--In order to make the VR game objects interactive, we will use the React 360 event
handlers, such as onEnter and onExit with Entity, and onClick with VrButton,
to add rotation animation and gameplay behavior.

--we will
add the implementations for rotating a VR object when a user focuses on it, and for
adding click behavior on the objects to allow a user to collect the correct objects in the
game.

Rotating a VR object::
--We want to add a feature that starts rotating a 3D object around its y axis whenever a
player focuses on the 3D object, that is, when the platform cursor begins intersecting
with the Entity component rendering the specific 3D object.

Animation with requestAnimationFrame::
--The rotation behavior for each 3D object is implemented in the event handlers added
to the Entity component, which is rendering the 3D object.

NB:
--The window.requestAnimationFrame() method asks the browser to call a specified callback function to update an animation
before the next repaint. With requestAnimationFrame, the browser optimizes the animations to make them smoother and more
resource-efficient.

--Though not covered here, it is also worth exploring the React 360 Animated library, which can be used to compose different types of
animations. Core components can be animated natively with this library, and it is possible to animate other components using
createAnimatedComponent(). This library was originally implemented from React Native.

Lecture 2:
Clicking on the 3D objects:::
--In order to register the click behavior on each 3D object added to the game, we need
to wrap the Entity component with a VrButton component that can call the
onClick handler

When a 3D object is clicked on by a user, we need the collectItem method to
perform the following actions with respect to the game features::
--Check whether the clicked object is an answerObject or a wrongObject.
Based on the object type, play the associated sound.
--If the object is an answerObject, it should be collected and removed from
view, then added to a list of collected objects.
--Check whether all instances of answerObject were successfully collected
with this click:
--If yes, show the game completed message to the player and
play the sound for game completed

Collecting the correct object on click::
--When a user clicks on a 3D object, we need to first check whether the clicked object is
an answer object. If it is, this object will be collected and hidden from view, and a list
of collected objects will be updated along with the total number to keep track of the
user's progress in the game.

--If the vrObject is an answerObject, indexOf will return the array index of the
matched object; otherwise, it will return -1 if no match is found.

--Using the collectedList array, we will also determine which Entity component should be hidden from the view because the associated object was collected. The
display style property of the relevant Entity component will be set based on the Boolean value of the corresponding index in the collectedList array.

--For example, in the following screenshot, the treasure chest can be clicked on to be collected as it is an answerObject, whereas the flower pot cannot be collected
because it is a wrongObject.

--When the treasure chest is clicked on, it disappears from the view as the collectedList is updated, and we also play the sound effect for collection using
AudioModule.playOneShot.
--As the flower pot was identified to be a wrong object, the collectedList was not updated and it remains on the screen, whereas the treasure chest is gone

--After a clicked object is collected using this method, we will also check whether all of the answerObjects have been collected and whether the game is complete with a
call to the checkGameCompleteStatus method

Lecture 6:
Game completed state::
--Every time an answerObject is collected, we will check whether the total number of collected items is equal to the total number of objects in the answerObjects array to
determine whether the game is complete.
--These style values will render the View component with the completion message at
the center of the user's current view, regardless of whether they are looking up,
down, behind, or forward in the 360-degree VR world.

--The replace method can be passed any valid URL, and once this React 360 game code is integrated with the MERN VR Game application in Chapter 14, Making the VR
Game Dynamic Using MERN, replace('/') will take the user to the home page of the whole application.

Lecture 7:
Bundling for production and integration with MERN::
--we will look at how to bundle the React 360 code, integrate it with a MERN application, and test the integration by running the game from the
application.

Bundling React 360 files::
--React 360 tools provide a script to bundle all of the React 360 application code into a
few files that we can just place on the MERN web server and serve as content at a
specified route

*******************yarn bundle*********************8

--This generates compiled versions of the React 360 application files in a folder called
build. The compiled bundle files are client.bundle.js and index.bundle.js.

--These two files, in addition to the index.html file and the static-assets/ folder,
make up the production version of the whole React 360 application that was
developed

Integrating with a MERN application::
